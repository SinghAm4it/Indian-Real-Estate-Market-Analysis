Project Title

Indian Real Estate Market Analysis & Forecasting

Project Overview

This project analyzes residential real estate listings across major Indian cities to understand pricing behavior, affordability, luxury segmentation, amenity value, and future price trends.

The analysis combines SQL-based analytics, Python-based EDA, forecasting using CAGR, and dashboard-level visualization concepts (Tableau – high level) to generate actionable market insights.

The project is designed to simulate how real estate analytics, consulting, or prop-tech firms evaluate markets for investment, pricing strategy, and demand forecasting.

Objectives

Understand price structure and segmentation across cities and localities

Identify affordability gaps and value-for-money zones

Analyze luxury concentration, inequality, and market dominance

Measure amenity and feature efficiency in pricing

Detect outliers, mispricing, and anomalies

Forecast future price per square foot using CAGR logic

Translate analytical findings into business-ready insights

Data & Tools Used
