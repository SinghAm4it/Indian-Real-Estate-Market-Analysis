# 🏙️ Real Estate Market Analytics & Pricing Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end real estate data analytics system** built using **advanced SQL analytics and forecasting techniques** to understand:

- City & locality price structures
- Luxury vs affordability dynamics
- Market inequality & concentration
- Value-for-money configurations
- Anomaly & mispricing detection
- Forward price forecasting using CAGR logic

The project is designed for **data analyst / business analyst roles** and mirrors the type of analysis used by **real estate consulting, prop-tech, and investment firms**.

## 🧱 Dataset Description
Each row represents a **property listing** with attributes such as:

- 📍 City, Locality  
- 🏠 Property Type (Apartment, Villa, Builder Floor, etc.)
- 🛏️ BHK Type  
- 📐 Total Area  
- 💰 Price (₹ Crores)
- 📊 Price per SQFT  
- 🚿 Bathrooms, Balcony  

A cleaned, standardized dataset (`clean_real_estate`) is used for all analysis.

## 🧠 Key Business Questions Answered
- Which **cities & localities** are overpriced or undervalued?
- Where does **luxury pricing** dominate the market?
- Which **BHKs give maximum area per crore**?
- How unequal are city markets (Gini, Theil, Atkinson)?
- Are high prices driven by **size, amenities, or pure premium**?
- Where do **data inconsistencies & mispricing anomalies** exist?
- What is the **expected price trajectory** for the next 1–3 years?
